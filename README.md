This is a API for a project manager application in Go.

During presenting my Semester Project for 3 Sem i found out that my college uses Pen and paper to mark students for their Projects and finalize it on excel sheets.
Another problem was that we had to go to them for submitting our papers and they use to check for plagraism. This was quite frustrating as it use to tire out the students as we use to go 6-7 times for our thesis to be renewed.
This is just the 10% problems that we face.

This prompted me to work to this API and dockerize this as a part of my learning and try to work on a real problem.

To run the Dockerfile
=> docker build -t projectmanager-api .

To run the APi
=> make
